# Workshop 2 - Day 3 - Testing applications - Exercises

The exercises can all be done within the same code sandbox.

## Exercise link:

You can find the code sandbox link here: <a href="@TODO" target="_blank">Code Sandbox exercises</a><br />
**Please remember:**
* to fork the code sandbox so you can send us your unique link with our
  solutions!
* to use Chrome or Chromium as Firefox has some issues with jest + code sandbox


I highly encourage you to try to solve the exercises without the solution
(especially the bonus exercises), as that will improve your knowledge
about the specific documentations that you will need many more times when
testing your own application's code! In case you really need to know the
solutions, you can find them here:
<a href="@TODO" target="_blank">Code Sandbox exercises - Solution</a>

## What to do

When you open the code sandbox, you will find eight files in the `src` folder.
Each of them contains one exercise.

Each exercise starts with a comment that will explain what you have to do.
Please try to solve all tasks by looking for the `@TODO` comments in the code.
They will let you know what exactly you have to do.

There are two different types of exercises:
* Tests for regular javascript functions
* Tests for reactjs components

The exercises are numbered (4 exercises for each type) and increase in
difficulty.

You're not required to finish working on the exercises right away, so please do
take the time that you need instead of trying to rush through them.
