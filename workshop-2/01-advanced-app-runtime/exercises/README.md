## Reference

- Check the [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LgLE2uEWeKGp8ik3aeV1gMbLvqqQSxxu/view?usp=sharing) for code examples for these 3 tasks
- App Runtime Hooks [documentation](https://runtime.dhis2.nu/#/hooks/) 

## TASK 1 - Using Dynamic queries and variables 

- In this task you will convert a static query into a dynamic one 
- Check comments `@TODO-1`
- You will be working in the `src/ProgramsList.js` component 

## TASK 2 - Using `Alerts` 

- Check the comments in the `src/ProgramList.js` component starting with `@TODO-2`
- In this task you will use a simple `useAlert` to show alerts when a program has been created 
- **NOTE**: To be able to see if a Program was successfully added, make sure that your text starts with the letter "A" (programs are rendered in alphabetical order)

## TASK 3 - Define a dynamic delete mutation  

- Here you will be working mostly in the `src/DeleteProgram.js` component 
- Check for comments starting with `@TODO-3`
- The goal of this task is to make the Delete button work
