# Project 2: Build a DHIS2 application

This project will focus on what you've learned during **Workshop 1 and 2** and you will take that knowledge to build a DHIS2 application. 🎊

Successful completion of this project and attendance in Workshop 2 are the prerequisites to earn a **DHIS2 Completion certificate** for this Academy program.

## Description

In this project you are going to be making a React application that uses the DHIS2 API to retrieve and send data to a DHIS2 instance using queries and mutations you have defined with the help of the DHIS2 Application Runtime.

You are free to choose the purpose of your application in this project. We only require that the requirements below be followed.

## Requirements

- [`@dhis2/ui`](https://ui.dhis2.nu/demo/) components **must**
  be used to build custom forms, tables and components wherever applicable 
- App **must** contain at least one component that uses a [data query](https://runtime.dhis2.nu/#/hooks/useDataQuery) (`useDataQuery` hook) _and_ at least one component that uses a [mutation](https://runtime.dhis2.nu/#/hooks/useDataMutation) (`useDataMutation` hook) from the DHIS2 Application Runtime
